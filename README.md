# Movie_Reviews :

Project Description : In this project , we have been provided with 2000 movie review files of which 1000 are positive reviews                       and 1000 are negative review files. We need to divide these files randomly into training and testing                           files.Then we need to predict the class of testing files out of negative and positive. I have used NLTK                       to clean the files and then used NaiveBayesClassifier of nltk to classify the data. After that I have                         changed the format of data stored and then used different sklearn classifiers to compare the scores from                       each classifier.
